# SQL - More queries
This README provides a summary of various MySQL topics and SQL techniques for managing users, granting permissions, working with constraints, subqueries, joins, distinct keyword, join types, union and minus operations, MySQL cheat sheet, SQL style guide, and MySQL 8.0 SQL statement syntax.
##Tasks ðŸ“ƒ
## Create a New User and Grant Permissions in MySQL
I Learn how to create a new user in MySQL and grant specific permissions using the GRANT statement to control access to databases and tables.
## Use MySQL GRANT Statement To Grant Privileges To a User
Understand how to use the MySQL GRANT statement to assign privileges to users, allowing them to perform specific actions on databases or tables.
## MySQL Constraints
Explore the concept of constraints in MySQL, which are rules used to enforce data integrity within tables, such as primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and check constraints.
## Multiple Joins and the DISTINCT Keyword
I Explore how to perform multiple joins in SQL to retrieve data from multiple tables simultaneously and how to use the DISTINCT keyword to eliminate duplicate rows from query results.
## Join Types
Understand different types of joins in SQL, such as INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN, and learn when to use each type based on your data retrieval requirements.
## Union and Minus
Learn how to use the UNION operator to combine results from multiple SELECT statements and the MINUS operator to subtract the results of one query from another.
## The Seven Types of SQL Joins
I Explore the seven types of SQL joins - INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN, CROSS JOIN, SELF JOIN, and NATURAL JOIN - to understand how data from multiple tables can be combined.
